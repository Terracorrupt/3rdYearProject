Bug List:

Collision - Still some collision errors
LevelBuilder - Should really only return the array of rectangles for each scenario, as LevelBuilder in it's current form
				acts more like a Level 1 class. Temporary Fix - Add Index into Constructor for level and switch on array of level;
Camera - Jittery when moving.
Fix SFX Volume and add more Music;
UnloadContents on all Scenes.
