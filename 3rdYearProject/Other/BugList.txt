Bug List:

Time - Need a better way of regulating time than TotalTime.elapsed, maybe define my own time Data structure.
Collision - Still some collision errors
LevelBuilder - Should really only return the array of rectangles for each scenario, as LevelBuilder in it's current form
				acts more like a Level 1 class.
Camera - Jittery when moving.
