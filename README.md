A Monogame game that hooks up to a MongoDB database, with a Node.js localhost webserver for a very simple Data Analytics test

Download and run by launching the runDatabase, runServer and runGame .bat files, in that order. If the game doesn't run you are
more than likely missing openall32.dll, so run the oalinst.exe to remedy this problem. It's legit, trust me :)
